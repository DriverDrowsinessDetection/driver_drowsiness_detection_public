Driver drowsiness is one of the causes of traffic accidents. According to the statistics; highway road crashes hold 11.09% of the total number of accidents. There are several reasons of drowsy driving such as: a lack of quality of sleep, may be overnight driving or having sleep disorders e.g. sleep apnea. However; all people should know that: People can not fight against to sleep. 

Using Image Processing and both classical and brand-new Machine Learning techniques such as SVM, k-NN, XGBoost, and also LSTM; we are trying to predict beforehand the driver's drowsiness and warning him/her with an alert before any crash happened.
